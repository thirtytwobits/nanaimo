Hi! Thanks for contributing. This page contains all the details about getting
your dev environment setup.

.. note::

    This is documentation for contributors developing nanaimo. If you are
    a user of this software you can ignore everything here.

virtualenv
================================================

I highly recommend using a virtual environment when doing python development. It'll save you hours
of lost productivity the first time it keeps you from pulling in an unexpected dependency from your
global python environment. You can install virtualenv from brew on osx or apt-get on linux. I'd
recommend the following environment for vscode::

    git submodule update --init --recursive
    virtualenv -p python3.7 .pyenv
    source .pyenv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip -e install .


Visual Studio Code
================================================

If you use vscode for python development you'll need to tweak the following settings to get all the
linters and previewers to work.

First off, use a `virtualenv`_, installing the project's :code:`requirements.txt` and an editable
version of the package itself.

This will enable running pytest from vscode. Now you can launch vscode for this repository::

    code .

For the python interpreter select the local .venv and set flake8 and mypy as your linters (we don't
use pylint for this project). The rest of your python environment should now be functional.


debugging
------------------------------------------------

The Python plugin for vscode comes with a full-featured Python debugger. To setup a debug session
for nnvg open the launch.json for your workspace and add a configuration like the following
to the configurations array::

    {
        "name": "Python: nantest",
        "type": "python",
        "request": "launch",
        "program": "${workspaceFolder}/src/nantest",
        "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
        "console": "integratedTerminal",
        "args": []
    }

.. note ::

    Note that each argument part must be a separate entry in the args array. Using a single space
    separated string does not work as you might expect since this results in a single string that
    contains spaces being passed as an argument.

You can setup a debug session for unit tests using a similar launch configuration that invokes the
:code:`pytest` module. For example::

    {
        "name": "Python: pyunit",
        "type": "python",
        "request": "launch",
        "module": "pytest",
        "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}/test",
        "console": "integratedTerminal",
        "args": ["--basetemp=${workspaceFolder}/build",
                 "-p", "no:cacheprovider",
                 "-k", "test_uart_monitor"]
    }

...where :code:`-k` is a pattern to filter for a specific test or set of tests (Omit all args to
debug all tests). The :code:`--basetemp` and :code:`-p no:cacheprovider` arguments prevent local
testing from conflicting with tox test runs.


.vscode/settings.json
------------------------------------------------

Here are some excerpts from my :code:`.vscode/settings.json` to help you get your linting,
unit-tests, and documentation previews all up and running.

I always work in a virtual environment. This selects the python version from that environment. ::

    "python.pythonPath": ".pyenv/bin/python3.7",

We use flake8 and mypy as part of the build. Enabling them in your IDE will give you real-time
feedback which makes your tox builds less interesting. ::

    "python.linting.pylintEnabled": false,
    "python.linting.mypyEnabled": true,
    "python.linting.flake8Enabled": true,
    "python.linting.enabled": true,

I've found the auto-discovery and pytest integration in vscode is very finicky. First, make sure
you've done a :code:`pip install -e .` for this repo (as described in the virtualenv section above).
After that be sure you use these exact settings and it should work ::

    "python.testing.cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
    "python.testing.unittestEnabled": false,
    "python.testing.nosetestsEnabled": false,
    "python.testing.pyTestEnabled": true,
    "python.testing.pyTestArgs": ["--rootdir=${workspaceFolder}",
                                  "${workspaceFolder}/test"],


You'll need to tweak two settings to get restructured text preview to work. ::

    "restructuredtext.sphinxBuildPath": "sphinx-build",
    "restructuredtext.confPath": "${workspaceFolder}/src"

If you installed everything in :code:`requirements.txt` then the python extension for vscode
will lint your .rst as you type and will support a fairly accurate reStructuredText preview.

Hopefully that helps. Let us know if these settings stop working.


************************************************
Running The Tests
************************************************

To run the full suite of `tox`_ tests locally you'll need docker. Once you have docker installed
and running do::

    git submodule update --init --recursive
    docker pull uavcan/toxic:py35-py38
    docker run --rm -it -v /path/to/nanaimo:/repo uavcan/toxic:py35-py38
    tox

import file mismatch
================================================

If you get an error like the following::

    _____ ERROR collecting test/gentest_dsdl/test_dsdl.py _______________________________________
    import file mismatch:
    imported module 'test_dsdl' has this __file__ attribute:
    /my/workspace/nanaimo/test/test_uart_monitor.py
    which is not the same as the test file we want to collect:
    /repo/test/test_uart_monitor.py
    HINT: remove __pycache__ / .pyc files and/or use a unique basename for your test file modules


Then you are probably a wonderful developer that is running the unit-tests locally. Pytest's cache
is interfering with your docker test run. To work around this simply delete the pycache files. For
example::

    #! /usr/bin/env bash
    cleandirs="src test"

    for cleandir in $cleandirs
    do
        find $cleandir -name __pycache__ | xargs rm -rf
        find $cleandir -name \.coverage\* | xargs rm -f
    done

Note that we also delete the .coverage intermediates since they may contain different paths between
the container and the host build.

************************************************
Building The Docs
************************************************

We rely on `read the docs`_ to build our documentation from github but we also verify this build
as part of our tox build. This means you can view a local copy after completing a full, successful
test run (See `Running The Tests`_) or do
:code:`docker run --rm -t -v /path/to/nanaimo:/repo uavcan/toxic:py35-py38 /bin/sh -c
"tox -e docs"` to build the docs target.
You can open the index.html under .tox/docs/tmp/index.html or run a local webserver::

    python -m http.server --directory .tox/docs/tmp &
    open http://localhost:8000/index.html

Of course, you can just use `Visual Studio Code`_ to build and preview the docs using
:code:`> reStructuredText: Open Preview`.

************************************************
Coverage and Linting Reports
************************************************

We publish the results of our coverage data to `Codacy`_ and the tox build will fail for any mypy
or flake8 errors but you can view additional reports locally under the :code:`.tox` dir.

Coverage
================================================

We generate a local html coverage report. You can open the index.html under .tox/report/tmp
or run a local webserver::

    python -m http.server --directory .tox/report/tmp &
    open http://localhost:8000/index.html

Mypy
================================================

At the end of the mypy run we generate the following summaries:

- .tox/mypy/tmp/mypy-report-lib/index.txt
- .tox/mypy/tmp/mypy-report-script/index.txt
